Developed by Kristian Lauszus.

This is the firmware for the my guide at the Arduino forum (http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,58048.0.html), including a Processing application (see /Graph) to visualize the data sent from the Arduino.

The code is developed for the "IMU Analog Combo Board Razor - 6DOF Ultra-Thin IMU" from Sparkfun (http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10010), but the code can easily be ported to any analog or digital IMU.
